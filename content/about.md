Before I started working in [the Environmental Change and Human Outcomes (ECHO)](https://www.stanfordecholab.com) Lab, I completed a dual Bachelor's degree in International Agriculture and Rural Development and the Environment and Sustainability, and a Master's degree in Applied Economics and Management from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu). 

My broad academic interests lie at the intersection of international development and the environment. Specifically, I explore questions such as how—and to what extent—climate change affects the well-being of people living in agricultural regions of developing countries, and what kinds of adaptation and resilience programs national governments and international donors should invest in. To investigate these issues, I use tools from applied economics, data science, and remote sensing.

I am originally from Gobi-Altai, Mongolia. I am an avid fan of Arsenal FC, and I do love playing soccer, basketball, or horseback riding whenever I can.
