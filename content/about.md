I am an incoming MS/Ph.D. candidate in Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University. I finished my undergraduate degree in International Agriculture and Rural Development and Environment and Sustainability from Cornell University in May 2022.

I am interested in a broad range of questions at the intersection of international development and environment. Specifically, I am interested in questions like how and to what extent changing climate affects the wellbeing of the people in the agricultural areas in developing countries. To answer these questions, I use the tools of economics and data science as well as remote sensing.
