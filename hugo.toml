I am currently a Research Data Analyst at the Center on Food Security and the Environment (FSE) and the Environmental Change and Human Outcomes (ECHO) Lab at Stanford University.
My academic interest lies at the intersection of global development and the environment. I focus on understanding the impact of climate change on rangelands, as well as exploring climate adaptation and resilience.
I am also interested in the programs, policies, and initiatives that accelerate adaptation to global warming. I explore these issues through academic research and independent data-driven projects. Feel free to read [about myself](/about) or to look at my most recent [publications](/publications) and [projects](/projects).

I have a few nicknamesâ€”most people call me Khusel (pronounced hoo-sell), but Khus (pronounced hooz) works too!
